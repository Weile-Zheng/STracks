Connecting Netease Music API with Spotify API to migrate Netease tracks to Spotify using 
NodeJS. 

Goals:
- Successfully migrate all tracks, with unfound tracks notified to end user
- UI Interface for user login and track management. 
- Ability to deselect certain tracks to migrate 
- Inclusion of native netease music interface instead of relying on playlist link/id
